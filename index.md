# What is React?
-    React is a JavaScript library - one of the most popular ones.
-    React is an open-source project created by Facebook.
-    React is used to build **user interfaces (UI)** on the front end.
-    React is the **view layer** of an MVC application (Model View Controller)

One of the most important aspects of React is the fact that you can **create components**, which are like custom, **reusable HTML elements**, to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces. React also streamlines how data is stored and handled, using state and props.
